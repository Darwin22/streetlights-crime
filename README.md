Street Light Outages and Crime in Chicago
==================

This a [Data Science for Social Good](http://www.dssg.io) project that estimates the association between alley and street light and outages in Chicago over the period April 2012 - July 2013.


## The power of city data

This project uses data from the [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).  Chicago has been leader in making city data publicly available.  We believe that this data allows for a variety of questions to be studied in a way that they have not been studied before.  Further, as this project demonstrates, the data can be used to study questions that matter and that are important for department planning.


## The Problem: Why Study Outages and Crime?

The [Chicago Department of Transportation](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html) (CDOT) received reports that some alley and street light outages were purposefully caused.  The department was concerned that individuals may be causing outages with the intent to commit crime in darker areas.  CDOT contacted us to investigate whether there was in fact a relationship between outages and crime around the city.


## Methodological Challenges: Correlation vs. Causation

Our aim is to obtain a causal estimate of the effect of outages on crime.  The fundamental challenge is that different areas may be both high crime and susceptible to outages.  Therefore, raw correlations may tend to overestimate the causal effect.


## Our Approach: Comparisons within Areas Affected by Outages

We estimate the association between outages and crime by comp
